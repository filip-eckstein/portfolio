    fullDescription: "An award-winning educational model created to demonstrate the basic principles of electrical installation wiring for students. This project won a competition for the best educational model made with 3D printing for secondary and higher vocational school students in the Czech Republic. The model shows various types of light-switch wiring and electrical installations in a clear and visual way that helps students understand complex electrical concepts. Designed with both functionality and educational value in mind, it combines 3D-printed components with electrical elements. The design and concept are my own.",
